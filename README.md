## üìñ About
This theme is inspired by Bubbles for Light Mode and Outer Space for Dark Mode hence the name "Bubble Space"! It's the theme I've been using in my creative vault for a while and still has some ways to go!

### (‚ú©Íí≥‚ú©) Space (Dark Mode)

## Extra: Space Animation
You can download the [Space Animations.css](https://github.com/Emrie-Candera/Bubble-Space-Theme/blob/f6eef48929ff1fa168cf43940314c2a66bba39df/Space%20Animations.css) as a snippet. This will enable a motion background of stars. This actually comes from the Christmas Theme's "snow" feature. When I tried it with my theme it looked like I was moving in space. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** I don't recommend using this on mobile. This slows down mobile performance big time.
